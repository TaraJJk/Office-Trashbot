# Office-Trashbot
 A smart robot was designed to collect trash from office rooms, particularly for IT companies. The robot was equipped to navigate through predefined routes and, at specific intervals, messages were sent to the janitor and individuals present in the rooms. The responsibility for the servo motor and RTC components was assigned to me as a team member.
